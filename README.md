## StreetPASS as a Gamemode
Made in VScript <br>
Primarily a 2v2 asymmetrical gamemode where only one team at a time can score  
Only Demoman and Soldier are available
- **BLU** starts as the attacking team that can score points  
- **RED** starts as the defending team that must protect the goal  
- **RED can swap roles with BLU** by scoring the J.A.C.K. into the **swap zone** 
- The first team to reach the **max score**, or have **more points** when time runs out, wins!
